👋🏼 I am an undergraduate student at the University of British Columbia ([UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/)) interested in Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence and Optimization. I have worked as a Research Assistant (RA) applying AI to many fields and as a software engineer. I am passionate about understanding how large neural networks work to develop safe and interpretable AI. 

I am the ML Lead for UBC [Uncrewed Aerial Systems](https://ubcuas.com/) (UAS) and the director of ML at the UBC AI club.
